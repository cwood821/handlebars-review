## Handlebars

Are

- [Declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming)
- Expressive

Provide

- [Separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) ([DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)/[Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle))
- *View layer* of Model-View-Controller Design Pattern/Architecture


Always read [the documentation](https://handlebarsjs.com/).

## Why should I learn this thing and not the other?

- Default templating language of [Ember](https://www.emberjs.com/)
- [Some organizations](https://stackshare.io/) use it
- Other [templating languages](https://twig.symfony.com) in different ecosystems are similar

## You can use it on the front and backend

Use it with:
- Plain JavaScript on the front end
- Express

---

## Concepts

- Context
- Loops
- Partials
- Conditionals/Helpers

## It's not always the right choice
There are [tradeoffs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmGfdlixQHo) to using templating languages, but they are powerful tools to separate responsibilities in your project.
