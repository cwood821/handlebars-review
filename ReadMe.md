# {{ Handlebars }} Review


## Why should I learn this thing and not the other?

- Default templating language of [Ember](https://www.emberjs.com/)
- [Some organizations](https://stackshare.io/) use it
- Other [templating languages](https://twig.symfony.com) in different ecosystems are similar

## Handlebars

A templating language that

is

- [Declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming)
- Expressive

and provides

- [Separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) ([DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)/[Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle))
- *View layer* of Model-View-Controller Design Pattern/Architecture


Check out the [the documentation](https://handlebarsjs.com/).

## Concepts

- Context
- Loops

## You can use it on the front and backend

Use it with:

## It's not always the right choice
There are [tradeoffs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmGfdlixQHo) to using templating languages, but they are powerful tools to separate responsibilities in your project.
